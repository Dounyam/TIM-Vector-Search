TIM is a high-performance **Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA)** search engine designed for ultra-low latency pattern matching in large-scale symbolic datasets. By leveraging **Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR)**, TIM encodes data into high-dimensional sinusoidal wave vectors, allowing for **O(1)** sublinear search via constructive/destructive wave interference.

Unlike traditional dense-vector search engines (e.g., FAISS) which require pre-trained neural networks, TIM operates on **raw symbolic data** (DNA sequences, malware signatures, logs) with **Zero-Shot encoding** and **No Training Data required**.

**No Embeddings • No Training • GPU-Accelerated • Real-Time**

## ⚡ Performance Benchmarks
*Hardware: Intel i7 + NVIDIA RTX 4060 (8GB VRAM)*

TIM outperforms standard linear search by orders of magnitude, capable of scanning **1,000,000 records in under 35ms**.

| Dataset Size      | Mode           | Latency (p95) | Pruning Efficiency | Throughput       |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **1,000 items**       | Fuzzy          | **12 ms**     | 98.7%              | 83 QPS           |
| **1,000,000 items**   | **Deep Fuzzy** | **207 ms**    | 98.4%              | ~5 QPS           |
| **1,000,000 items**   | **Instant Exact** | **32 ms**  | **100.0%**         | **~31,000 QPS**  |

> **Note:** "Pruning Efficiency" refers to the percentage of the database discarded instantly via Harmonic Resonance before expensive vector comparisons occur.

## 🧠 Configurable Search Modes

TIM features an **Adaptive Resonance Threshold**, allowing operators to toggle between sub-50ms exact matching and deep fuzzy forensic search on the fly without rebuilding the index.

| Mode              | Threshold | Use Case                                                                                          |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deep Discovery**| `0.99f`   | **Forensics.** Finds hidden mutations, typosquatting (e.g., `p@ypal.com`), and obfuscated code.   |
| **Instant Exact** | `1.01f`   | **Blocklisting.** Real-time firewall checks. Filters 100% of noise to return only exact or near-perfect matches instantly. |

## 🛠 Key Innovations

- **Holographic Wave Encoding:** Maps characters to phase-shifted sine waves, padding sequences for uniform length and creating unique high-dimensional vectors.
- **Resonance Node Indexing:** A proprietary hierarchical memory graph. It effectively acts as a "physics-based bloom filter," pruning 98%+ of the search space based on signal amplitude.
- **Quantum-Inspired Interference:** Computes similarity via dot-product fidelity with resonance bonuses, mimicking quantum superposition on classical hardware.
- **OpenCL Kernels:** Custom C-based kernels optimized for the RTX series, handling massive parallel string convolution.
